This feature allows creation of surface (sheet) bodies from all of the faces of the selected solid or surface bodies.

All resulting bodies are grouped under single feature and maintain parametric approach. If original geometry changes (including adding or removing of faces) feature is automatically regenerated with new bodies updated.
