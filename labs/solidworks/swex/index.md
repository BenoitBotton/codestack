SwEx (SOLIDWORKS Extra or SOLIDWORKS Extended) is a framework which is designed to simplify development of software for SOLIDWORKS in .NET (C# and VB.NET).

Framework provides utilities for implementation software design principles such as [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) for developing maintainable and scalable solutions for SOLIDWORKS.

There are 3 main section of SOLIDWORKS API functionality which are covered by framework

* [Add-In](add-in) - add-in skeleton, commands, menus, toolbars, events management, data access
* [Property Manager Pages](pmpage) - building native property manager pages with data binding
* [Macro Feature](macro-feature) - building parametric native features

Framework source code is available on GitHub.
