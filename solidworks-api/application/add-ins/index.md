Add-ins are in-process extension to SOLIDWORKS. Add-ins are COM objects and must implement the [ISwAddin](http://help.solidworks.com/2012/english/api/swpublishedapi/solidworks.interop.swpublished~solidworks.interop.swpublished.iswaddin.html) interface in SOLIDWORKS API.

Add-ins can be developed with any COM-compatible language: C++, C#, VB.NET, VB6, Managed C++.

Add-ins are available under the Tools->Add-Ins dialog in SOLIDWORKS menu.
